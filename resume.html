    <h1>MY RESUME</h1>
    <h2>carriar object</h2>
    <h4>What makes this a good Resume Objective?
This Career Objective successfully (and quickly) makes the argument that
 this candidate would succeed in a managerial role.
  The hiring manager would immediately be interested in a
  candidate with 4+ years of experience learning relevant skills
   of telephone/face-to-face sales, hotel bookings, and account administration.
    The hiring manager would be even more interested in the fact that this candidate has proven
    to be masterful in previous job roles, specifically in sales and communication skills</h4>
